GNU Sqltutor - Summary

Interactive web based tool for learning SQL by examples. SQLtutor
consists of two main modules: a database of questions and answers and
a simple CGI interface for running tests. Questions are chosen at
random for each session, submitted queries are checked against correct
answers stored in the database. Query results differing only in column
permutations are evaluated as correct. For each session queries and
answers are logged and the final score is evaluated when the test is
finished. SQLtutor is written in C++ with lipqxx library to connect to
PostgreSQL database. SQLtutor runs on GNU/Linux.

Installing PostGIS on Debian GNU/Linux
--------------------------------------

First install PostGIS packages:

$ apt-get install postgis postgresql-8.4-postgis

PostGIS datasets require database with PostGIS support, you can create
such database e.g. with the following commands (depends on PostGIS
version):

$ createdb sqltutor
$ createlang plpgsql sqltutor
$ psql -d sqltutor -f /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql
$ psql -d sqltutor -f /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/postgis-1.5/spatial_ref_sys.sql
