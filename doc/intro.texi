@dfn{GNU Sqltutor} is a web based interactive tutorial of
@emph{Structured Query Language} (SQL).  You can try Sqltutor online
from
@c
@uref{http://sqltutor.fsv.cvut.cz/,
      http://sqltutor.fsv.cvut.cz/,

@noindent First, a tutorial must be selected from the opening 
page and started. A series of tutorial questions follows in a simple
dialog. When finished Sqltutor displays final evaluation with the
review of all questions asked during the session together with user's
SQL queries and correct answers for wrong solutions.

Sqltutor is implemented on the top of a relational database system
PostgreSQL.  The project consists in part of a C++ program of the same
name @file{sqltutor} released under the GNU General Public License
(GNU GPL).  The @file{sqltutor} program is a CGI script that selects
SQL questions from its database, checks the answers and evaluates the
final score.  The second part of the project is a free collection of
SQL questions and answers representing SQL tutorials. Sqltutor enables
to run one or more tutorials in different languages from a single
database.


@section SQLzoo

Sqltutor was inspired by an interactive tutorial SQLzoo by Andrew
Cumming from the School of Computing, Napier University, Edinburg,
UK. Implementation of the database and the @file{sqltutor} program is
not dependent neither derived from the SQLzoo tutorial.

English SQLzoo tutorial distributed with Sqltutor is based on the
collection of SQL questions and answers and datasets from
@url{http://sqlzoo.net/}. We would like to thank Andrew Cumming for
his kind approval to use his data and tutorials in our project.
